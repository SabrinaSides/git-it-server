# Git It

## Summary

Git It is a full-stack PERN app designed as a mock coding-related merch site. The user is able to view products, add and delete items from their shopping cart and complete a demo checkout process.

The GitIt API utilizes GET, POST and DELETE endpoints along with the corresponding postgreSQL databases. The app's client-side was also written by me and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SabrinaSides/git-it-client).
